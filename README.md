Project Name: Business Redesign 

Description:  You will be taking a local business and do a redesign to their existing site. This redesign should improve their site and make it more up to date.

Peer review: Brock Spacek

Comments: Overall the site was pretty well done and improved upon. The figma was followed as intended and done well. I found a few things that can be improved. The first thing is that when you click on casket flowers, the header says you are now in the Valentine's day section instead of casket section so that threw me off. A few of the images are somewhat blurry including in the casket and bridal images, I'm assuming these assets were downloaded from the previous site. I would have also liked to see the links in the footer be clickable and take me to the Facebook and Instagram pages. The sign in page does not lead to anything, not sure if intentional. Finally, in the sympathy section, the ribbon script isn't bold like it is on the figma. The site has just a couple of fixes, but other than that it looks good!!!
