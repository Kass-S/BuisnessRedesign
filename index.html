      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>"Flowers are my life not my hobby. “ It all started over 50 years ago at The Flower Box on Pacific Avenue in Stockton, CA. I was the baby in the car seat in the middle of the design table, and the kid on the flower cart at the San Francisco Flower Market. My grandparents John and Dorothy Plotz owned and operated The Flower Box, and that is where I was raised and spent every single holiday until the wee hours of the mornings learning my craft. I continued to sharpen my skills while attending Cal Poly SLO, graduating with a Bachelor’s of Science in Ornamental Horticulture and returned home to run the shop eventually merging The Flower Box and Fiore Floral and Gifts into one Linden location in 2003. The San Francisco Flower Market is my second home, I have built relationships with growers over the course of my entire life, and they always save the best and freshest goodies for us, each week it’s a treat to see what they might have stashed away special for the “old timers”, and I get to bring those treats back to you. From the simple loose wrap to an elaborate party we continue to provide the best and freshest flowers around with the education and years of design experience to fill all your floral needs, large or small. Stop in and see us. Fiore’s is where a passion has become a lifelong commitment to the community and beauty, knowledge, and artistry of flowers. We are: “A florist for every reason and every season.” Open daily Monday-Friday, Saturday’s & Sunday’s by appointment and during peak holidays we are consistently here for you.
